      <p class="leftpadding"> My final project is called Local Jam. Working on it has been a long, rough journey with
        peaks and valleys that culminated in a product
        I am very proud of. I have a much better understanding of CRUD (create read update destroy) with regards to Laravel and Vue components. One
        moment I am proud of is when I
        implemented a Vue component to pass multiple ids on click to route to the table controller and update the
        associated bridge table in my database.</p>
        <p class="leftpadding">
        This project stretched my imagination and I learned to test my theories to see what is possible.
        One example of this is when I wrote a bit of code that threads PHP in with html. I used PHP to compare table
        values and html to display them. I was forced to think outside the box and was rewarded for doing so.
        My logic skills were put to the test when I created my search page to create multiple arrays of objects from
        different tables, loop through those arrays and compare object values, use object values from one table to
        access and compare values from another, and finally to display the correct values on the page. Nested loops
        abound!!</p> 
        <p class="leftpadding">
        As a programmer, I have grown a great deal through designing and implementing Local Jam. My knowledge
        of and appreciation for Vue and Laravel has grown immensely, and I have a mcuh better intrinsic understanding of
        the MVC (model view controller) relationship. Also it is very rewarding to see a project through from inception to
        execution to demonstration.

      <p class="leftpadding"> This week I re-factored my to-do app into Laravel and Vue, using axios post and get calls
        and MySQL to handle database management. I enjoy working with back-end more so than front-end, as I love working
        with data. Looking forward to starting work on my final project.</p>

      <p class="leftpadding"> PHP is very similar to JavaScript save for a few key differences. Dealing with scope
        and
        arrays are the two biggest differences I've noticed thus far. I'm glad we started with PHP instead of
        JavaScript
        because it is easier to console.log, debug, and get a clearer overall picture with Javascript. You don't
        have to
        reload the page when you want to check functionality.</p>


      <p class="leftpadding"> I have noticed the implementation of the clock app specifically can be reduced to
        almost a
        single line of code in PHP whereas in JavaScript the code is much more verbose.

      <p class="leftpadding">My first week of coding bootcamp went well. The combination of various emotions
        has
        resulted in a net
        positive
        and I am excited to continue my educational journey.
        As expected, the small class setting has undoubtedly saved countless hours of frustration as I can ask
        a
        neighbor or instructor for guidance when I get stuck
        instead of Googling for hours to fix a bug that should have taken minutes. The atmosphere is conducive
        to
        learning and everyone has been helpful and encouraging.
      </p>

      <p class="leftpadding">This week I would like to get better at truly understanding every line of code I
        write as I
        write it. This past week I hurriedly threw many snippets of code into my project without fully
        understanding
        their functionality. In the future I would like to take my time and understand the interconnectivity
        of
        every
        line of code in my project in order to mitigate issues like unintentional overwriting and unexpected
        behavior.
