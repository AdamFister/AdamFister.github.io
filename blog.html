        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <h5>First Week of Awesome Inc Bootcamp</h5>

        <p>My first week of coding bootcamp went well. The combination of various emotions has resulted in a net
          positive
          and I am excited to continue my educational journey.
          As expected, the small class setting has undoubtedly saved countless hours of frustration as I can ask a
          neighbor or instructor for guidance when I get stuck
          instead of Googling for hours to fix a bug that should have taken minutes. The atmosphere is conducive to
          learning and everyone has been helpful and encouraging.
        </p>
        <p>One cool thing I learned this week about coding is the importance of the .map, .filter, and .reduce functions
          in JavaScript. I was previously aware of them but I am led to believe they are much more powerful and
          efficient than I had previously imagined.
        </p>
        <p>One thing I would like to get better at this week is truly understanding every line of code I write as I
          write it. This past week I hurriedly threw many snippets of code into my project without fully understanding
          their functionality. In the future I would like to take my time and understand the interconnectivity of every
          line of code in my project in order to mitigate issues like unintentional overwriting and unexpected behavior.
        </p>
        <p>One resource that I think would help everyone else in Bootcamp is <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">https://www.freecodecamp.org</a></p>
        <p>The number one thing that held me back this week is not enough Oreos and coffee.</p>

        <p>I have an "Aha!" moment almost every day during JavaScript warmup. I like extending my limits and it's fun
          learning about different approaches to the same problem.</p>
